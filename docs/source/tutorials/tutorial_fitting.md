# Running the model inference

Once a model has been defined and priors have been assigned to all parameters, **``socca``** provides a unified interface for running the inference. This section describes the available sampling methods, their configuration options, and how to analyze and save the results.

## Initializing the fitter

Initializing and running the model inference is as simple as creating a `fitter` object and calling its `run()` method. Assuming that we have already defined a composite model `mod` and have an image `img` to fit, the inference can be started as follows:

```python
>>> from socca import fitter
>>> from socca.data import Image
>>> from socca.models import Model
>>> 
>>> mod = Model()
>>> #  ... add components to the model and set priors ...
>>>
>>> img = Image.load('path/to/your/image.fits')
>>> #  ... set up the image (PSF, noise model, mask, etc.) ...
>>>
>>> fit = fitter(mod=mod, img=img)
>>> fit.run()
```

The `fitter` object handles all the necessary bookkeeping, including the construction of the likelihood function based on the noise model and the mapping between the prior distributions and the model parameters.

```{caution}
An additional sampling backend based on [`numpyro`](https://num.pyro.ai/) NUTS ([No-U-Turn Sampler](https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/mcmc.html#numpyro.infer.hmc.NUTS)) is included in the codebase but has not been thoroughly tested. It is left available for experimental use and development purposes only. Users interested in trying the `numpyro` backend should be aware that its behavior and results may not be fully validated.
```

## Fitting methods

There are several methods available for performing the model inference, including nested sampling, Monte Carlo sampling, and maximum a posteriori optimization. The choice of method can be specified via the `method` argument of the `run()` method. The following sections describe the available options and their configuration.

### Available samplers

**``socca``** supports multiple backends for performing the model inference via Bayesian posterior sampling, which can be selected via the `method` argument when calling the `run()` method. The available options are:

| Method        | Description | Link |
|:-------------:|-------------|:----:|
| `'nautilus'`<br>(default) | Neural network-accelerated nested sampling | [竊余(https://github.com/johannesulf/nautilus) |
| `'dynesty'`   | Dynamic nested sampling | [竊余(https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty) |
| `'pocomc'`    | Preconditioned Monte Carlo sampling | [竊余(https://github.com/minaskar/pocomc) |
| `'emcee'`     | Affine-invariant ensemble MCMC | [竊余(https://github.com/dfm/emcee) |

Any of the options above can be selected by passing the corresponding string to the `method` argument of the `run()` method. To customize the behavior of each sampling method, any of the keyword arguments accepted by the respective sampler class can be passed to the `run()` method. These are automatically forwarded to the underlying sampler implementation. For a complete list of available options for each method, please refer to the respective documentation linked in the table above.

```{note}
The first three methods (`nautilus`, `dynesty`, `pocomc`) take advantage of nested sampling or precondition Monte Carlo algorithms to sample the posterior distributions and compute the Bayesian evidence. The `emcee` method, instead, is an MCMC sampler that does not provide evidence estimates, so it cannot be used for Bayesian model comparison. Alternative model selection criteria will be implemented in the future.
```

For instance, to use the `dynesty` sampler with 500 live points, one would do:

```python
>>> fit.run(method='dynesty', nlive=500)
```

To use the `emcee` sampler with 32 walkers running for 5000 steps:

```python
>>> fit.run(method='emcee', nwalkers=32, nsteps=5000, discard=1000, thin=10)
```

The `emcee` sampler also supports automatic convergence checking based on the integrated autocorrelation time:

```python
>>> fit.run(method='emcee', nwalkers=32, nsteps=10000, converge=True)
```

When `converge=True`, the sampler monitors the autocorrelation time and stops when the chain has converged. The burn-in (`discard`) and thinning (`thin`) are then automatically determined from the final autocorrelation time estimates.

After the sampling is completed, the key results are stored in the following attributes of the `fitter` object:

| Attribute     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `fit.samples` | Array of posterior samples with shape `(n_samples, n_params)` |
| `fit.weights` | Importance weights for each sample (uniform for `emcee`) |
| `fit.logz`    | Log-evidence estimate (not available for `emcee`) |

```{note}
The `fit.sampler` attribute provides direct access to the underlying sampler object (e.g., `nautilus.Sampler`, `dynesty.NestedSampler`, `pocomc.Sampler`, or `emcee.EnsembleSampler`), which can be useful for accessing additional diagnostics or methods specific to each sampling library. For `emcee`, additional attributes include `fit.tau` (integrated autocorrelation time per parameter) and `fit.tau_history` (convergence history).
```

### Maximum a posteriori estimation

For fast point estimates, it is also possible to run a maximum a posteriori (MAP) optimization using the `'optimizer'` method, that uses the L-BFGS-B algorithm from `scipy.optimize.minimize`:

```python
>>> fit.run(method='optimizer')
```

```{important}
The optimization is designed to include the effect of priors on the posterior distribution. To do so, as in nested sampling, parameters are drawn from the unit hypercube and then projected onto the prior space using the inverse cumulative distribution function of the respective prior. The resulting parameters are then used to compute the prior-conditioned log-likelihood to be maximized.
```

The key argument for this method is `pinits`, which controls the starting point of the optimization:
| Option | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| `'median'` (default) | Start from the 50th percentile of all prior distributions (i.e., the midpoint of the unit hypercube) |
| `'random'` | Start from a random point in the unit prior hypercube |
| array-like | A custom array of initial values with one value per free parameter |

As for the other sampling methods, additional keyword arguments accepted by `scipy.optimize.minimize` (such as `tol`, `options`, etc.) can be passed directly to the `run()` method and will be forwarded to the optimizer.

The optimization results are stored in `fit.results`, which is a `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` object providing access to the optimal parameters (`fit.results.x`), the final log-likelihood value (`-fit.results.fun`), and convergence information (`fit.results.success`, `fit.results.message`).

## Accessing and saving the best-fit model

After running the inference, the `fitter` object provides a convenient `getmodel()` method to generate model images using the best-fit or median posterior parameters:

```python
>>> # Get all model components (raw, smoothed, background)
>>> model_raw, model_smoothed, model_background = fit.getmodel()
>>>
>>> # Get only the PSF-convolved model (excluding background)
>>> model_smoothed = fit.getmodel(what='smoothed')
```

The `getmodel()` method accepts the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `what` | Which model component(s) to return (see below) |
| `component` | Which model component(s) to include in the computation (see below) |
| `usebest` | If `True` (default), use median posterior parameters; if `False`, compute median of model realizations |
| `img` | Alternative `Image` object to evaluate the model on (default: use the fitted image) |
| `doresp` | Apply response/exposure correction (default: `False`) |
| `doexp` | Apply exposure map weighting (default: `False`) |

The `what` argument controls the output:

| Option | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| `'all'`<br>(default) | Returns a tuple of `(raw, smoothed, background)` |
| `'raw'` | Unconvolved model (excluding background) |
| `'smoothed'`<br>`'conv'`<br>`'convolved'` | PSF-convolved model (excluding background) |
| `'background'`<br>`'bkg'` | Background component only |

Multiple components can be requested as a list:

```python
>>> model_raw, model_background = fit.getmodel(what=['raw', 'background'])
```

The `component` argument allows generating the model from specific model components only, rather than the full composite model:
- `None` (default): Include all model components
- Integer: Single component index (e.g., `component=0` for the first component)
- List of integers: Multiple component indices (e.g., `component=[0, 2]`)
- String: Component name (e.g., `component='comp_00'`)
- Component object: The component instance itself

```python
>>> # Get model for only the first component
>>> model_raw, model_smoothed, model_background = fit.getmodel(component=0)
>>>
>>> # Get model for specific components
>>> model_raw, model_smoothed, model_background = fit.getmodel(component=[0, 2])
```

When `usebest=True` (default), the model is computed using the weighted median of the posterior samples for each parameter. When `usebest=False`, the method instead computes the model for each posterior sample individually and returns the median of the resulting model realizations. The latter approach can be useful for capturing non-linear effects in the model, but is significantly slower.

For the optimizer method, `getmodel()` uses the optimal parameters found during optimization (`fit.results.x`), regardless of the `usebest` setting.

You can also save the best-fit model directly to a FITS file with preserved WCS information. For instance, to save the raw model:

```python
>>> fit.savemodel('raw_model.fits', what='raw')
Generating raw model
Saved to raw_model.fits
```

The `savemodel()` method accepts the same arguments as `getmodel()` (such as `what`, `component`, `usebest`, `doresp`, `doexp`), and writes the resulting model image to a FITS file with the WCS header from the input image.

```python
>>> # Save only the first component's model
>>> fit.savemodel('component_0.fits', component=0)
```

When saving a single model type, the FITS header includes a `MODEL` keyword indicating it. When saving multiple types as a list, the output is a multi-slice FITS file with header keywords `NSLICES` (total number of slices) and `SLICE1`, `SLICE2`, etc. identifying the specific model in each slice.


## Checkpointing and resuming

All sampling methods support saving the sampler state during the run, allowing interrupted runs to be resumed:

```python
>>> fit.run(checkpoint='my_fit_checkpoint')
```

For `nautilus`, `dynesty`, and `emcee`, this will save the sampler state synchronously into an HDF5 file named `my_fit_checkpoint.hdf5` in the current working directory. In the case of `pocomc`, the sampler state is saved to a directory named `my_fit_checkpoint_pocomc_dump` at regular intervals (by default, every 10 iterations).

By default, if a checkpoint file matching the provided name is found, **``socca``** will resume sampling from the last saved state. To force a fresh run:

```python
>>> fit.run(checkpoint='my_fit_checkpoint', resume=False)
```

```{note}
The checkpoint file format and location depend on the sampling backend. For `nautilus` and `emcee`, the sampler state is saved synchronously via an HDF5 backend. For `dynesty` and `pocomc`, states are saved at regular intervals.
```

## Bayesian model comparison

For the `nautilus`, `dynesty`, and `pocomc` sampling methods, **``socca``** can compute Bayesian model comparison statistics. Note that `emcee` does not compute evidence estimates and therefore cannot be used for performing Bayesian model comparison.

```python
>>> fit.run(getzprior=True)  # Enable prior evidence estimation
>>> ln_BayesFac_raw, sigma_eff_raw, \
... ln_BayesFac_deboost, sigma_eff_deboost = fit.bmc()

null-model comparison
=====================
ln(Bayes factor) :  1.743E+05
effective sigma  :  5.907E+02

prior deboosted
=====================
ln(Bayes factor) :  1.725E+05
effective sigma  :  5.876E+02
```

The `getzprior=True` option runs an additional sampling step to estimate the prior evidence, which is used to compute the prior-corrected Bayes factor. The output includes:
- `ln_BayesFact_raw`: Raw log Bayes factor (vs. null model)
- `effect_sigma_raw`: Effective sigma significance
- `ln_BayesFact_deboost`: Prior-deboosted log Bayes factor
- `effect_sigma_deboost`: Prior-deboosted effective sigma


## Saving and loading results

To save the complete fitting results for later analysis:

```python
>>> fit.dump('my_fit_results.pickle')
```

This serializes the entire `fit` object, including the model, data, and all sampling results, using `dill`. To reload:

```python
>>> fit = socca.load('my_fit_results.pickle')
```

## Checking the results

### Printing best-fit parameters

For a quick summary of the inferred parameters, the `parameters()` method prints the best-fit values along with their associated uncertainties (computed from the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distributions). For instance, for the model in the "[Getting started](./tutorial_quickstart.md)" tutorial, you would get:

```python
>>> fit.parameters()

Best-fit parameters
========================================

comp_00
-------
xc :  2.0000E+01 [+8.1399E-07/-8.0507E-07]
yc : -1.0000E+01 [+7.4631E-07/-7.2487E-07]
Ic :  9.7130E+00 [+3.5537E-01/-3.6794E-01]

comp_01
-------
theta :  8.7389E-01 [+4.4078E-03/-4.2317E-03]
e     :  6.0286E-01 [+3.7462E-03/-3.6892E-03]
re    :  4.1755E-04 [+3.3501E-06/-3.2982E-06]
Ie    :  3.0145E-01 [+2.9658E-03/-2.9120E-03]
```

Both median value and uncertainties for each parameter are computed from the weighted posterior samples stored in `fit.samples` and `fit.weights`.

```{warning}
The uncertainties reported by `parameters()` are marginal uncertainties derived from the 1D posterior distributions. For parameters with significant correlations, the full covariance structure should be examined using the corner plot or by directly analyzing `fit.samples`.
```
