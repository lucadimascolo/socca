``socca`` is a minimal library for efficiently modelling image-space astronomical data. 
It is intended to be fast and flexible, taking advantage of the [`JAX`](https://github.com/google/jax) framework for performing just-in-time compilation and of state-of-the-art nested sampling algorithms ([`dynesty`](https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty), [`nautilus`](https://nautilus-sampler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) for the posterior exploration.

The code is
