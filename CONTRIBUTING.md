# Contributing to `socca`

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `socca`! This is an open-source library that has grown thanks to feedback and contributions from many students and fellow researchers. As such, any contributions from the community is greatly appreciated, be it in the form of bug reports, feature requests, or direct code edits.


## Development workflow

- **Keep it simple ⚡**
`socca` is intentionally built to use a minimal set of dependencies, and to be as lightweight as possible. As such, we suggest that any new code contributions follow the same philosophy, avoiding the introduction of new dependencies unless strictly necessary.

- **Keep it clear 📝**
Please keep changes focused and well-documented, making sure to use clear commit messages. Once you are ready to submit your changes, please open a pull request against the `dev` branch, providing a clear description of the changes you are proposing.

- **Did you find a bug? 🐛**
If you encounter a bug while using `socca`, please open an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/your-repo/socca/issues). Be sure to include a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant error messages or logs.

- **Have a feature request? ✨**
If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement, please [open an issue](https://github.com/lucadimascolo/socca/issues/new) and describe your suggestion in detail. We welcome all ideas and will consider them for future releases if they align with the project's goals.
